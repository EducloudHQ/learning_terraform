## Installing Terraform

Terraform can be installed on Windows, Linux and OS X. 

There's an easy step-by-step guide on how to install Terraform on your operating system, on the official [Terraform site](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

After successfully installing Terraform, verify your installation by running this command from your commandline interface(cli) to list Terraform's available subcommands.


`terraform -help`

Let's get Started.

From your CLI, let's create a folder called `data_backup_tf` and cd(change directory) into it

```
mkdir data_backup_tf
cd data_backup_tf
```
