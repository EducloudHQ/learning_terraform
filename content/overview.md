# Introduction to Terraform

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EducloudHQ/learning_terraform/master/assets/terraform.png)
When developing applications for the cloud,engineers are constantly defining resources, managing those resources, sharing the resource configuration across team members, in order to ensure consistency, versioning and a lot more.

All these are accomplished using Infrastructure as Code(Iac) tools.

Created by a company called HashiCorp,Terraform is an infrastructure as Code tool that lets you define resources and infrastructure in a safe, consistent and human-readable way in configuration files.

With Terraform, you can easily provision resources like virtual machines, load balancers, and databases on popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

One of the most significant benefits of Terraform is that it allows for collaboration between team members. By using version control systems like Git, infrastructure code can be managed and reviewed in a similar way to application code.

Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments.

In this course, we'll be learning Terraform by building 2 projects.

**Project 1** would focus on deploying an EC2 server connected to a load balancer and a security group to AWS.

**Project 2**  would go more indepth in to AWS Serverless services, where we'll create an application that regularly backs up your data
from a DynamoDB table into an S3 bucket.
